                                            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br /><br /> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lthttps://fsf.org/&rt<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br /><br />                            Preamble<br /><br />  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br />software and other kinds of works.<br /><br />  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br />to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br />the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br />share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br />software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br />GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br />any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br />your programs, too.<br /><br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br />want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br />free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br /><br />  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br />these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br />certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br />you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br /><br />  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br />gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br />freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br />or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br />know their rights.<br /><br />  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br />(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br />giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br /><br />  For the developers\' and authors\' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br />that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\' and<br />authors\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br />changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br />authors of previous versions.<br /><br />  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br />modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br />can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br />protecting users\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br />pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br />use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br />have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br />products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br />stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br />of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br /><br />  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br />States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br />software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br />avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br />make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br />patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br /><br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />modification follow.<br /><br />                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />  0. Definitions.<br /><br />  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br /><br />  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br />works, such as semiconductor masks.<br /><br />  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br />License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br />"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br /><br />  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br />in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br />exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br />earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br /><br />  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br />on the Program.<br /><br />  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br />permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br />infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br />computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br />distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br />public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br /><br />  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br />parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br />a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br /><br />  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br />to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br />feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br />tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br />extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br />work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br />the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br />menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br /><br />  1. Source Code.<br /><br />  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br />for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br />form of a work.<br /><br />  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br />standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br />interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br />is widely used among developers working in that language.<br /><br />  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br />than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br />packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br />Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br />Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br />implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br />"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br />(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br />(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br />produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br /><br />  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br />the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br />work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br />control those activities.  However, it does not include the work\'s<br />System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br />programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br />which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br />includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br />the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br />linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br />such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br />subprograms and other parts of the work.<br /><br />  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br />can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br />Source.<br /><br />  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br />same work.<br /><br />  2. Basic Permissions.<br /><br />  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br />copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br />conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br />permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br />covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br />content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br />rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br /><br />  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br />convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br />in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br />of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br />with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br />the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br />not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br />for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br />and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br />your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br /><br />  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br />the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br />makes it unnecessary.<br /><br />  3. Protecting Users\' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br /><br />  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br />measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br />11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br />similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br />measures.<br /><br />  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br />circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br />is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br />the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br />modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\'s<br />users, your or third parties\' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br />technological measures.<br /><br />  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br /><br />  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\'s source code as you<br />receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br />appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br />keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br />non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br />keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br />recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br /><br />  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br />and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br /><br />  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br /><br />  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br />produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br />terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br /><br />    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br />    it, and giving a relevant date.<br /><br />    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br />    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br />    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br />    "keep intact all notices".<br /><br />    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br />    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br />    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br />    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br />    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br />    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br />    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br /><br />    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br />    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br />    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br />    work need not make them do so.<br /><br />  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br />works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br />and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br />in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br />"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br />used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\'s users<br />beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br />in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br />parts of the aggregate.<br /><br />  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br /><br />  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br />of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br />machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br />in one of these ways:<br /><br />    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br />    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br />    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br />    customarily used for software interchange.<br /><br />    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br />    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br />    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br />    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br />    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br />    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br />    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br />    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br />    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br />    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br />    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br /><br />    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br />    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br />    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br />    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br />    with subsection 6b.<br /><br />    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br />    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br />    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br />    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br />    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br />    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br />    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br />    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br />    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br />    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br />    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br />    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br /><br />    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br />    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br />    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br />    charge under subsection 6d.<br /><br />  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br />from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br />included in conveying the object code work.<br /><br />  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br />tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br />or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br />into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br />doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br />product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br />typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br />of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br />actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br />is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br />commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br />the only significant mode of use of the product.<br /><br />  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br />procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br />and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br />a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br />suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br />code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br />modification has been made.<br /><br />  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br />specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br />part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br />User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br />fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br />Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br />by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br />if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br />modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br />been installed in ROM).<br /><br />  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br />requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br />for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br />the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br />network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br />adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br />protocols for communication across the network.<br /><br />  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br />in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br />documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br />source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br />unpacking, reading or copying.<br /><br />  7. Additional Terms.<br /><br />  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br />License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br />Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br />be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br />that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br />apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br />under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br />this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br /><br />  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br />remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br />it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br />removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br />additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br />for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br /><br />  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br />add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br />that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br /><br />    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br />    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br /><br />    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br />    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br />    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br /><br />    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br />    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br />    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br /><br />    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br />    authors of the material; or<br /><br />    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br />    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br /><br />    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br />    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br />    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br />    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br />    those licensors and authors.<br /><br />  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br />restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br />received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br />governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br />restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br />a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br />License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br />of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br />not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br /><br />  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br />must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br />additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br />where to find the applicable terms.<br /><br />  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br />form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br />the above requirements apply either way.<br /><br />  8. Termination.<br /><br />  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br />provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br />modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br />this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br />paragraph of section 11).<br /><br />  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br />license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br />provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br />finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br />holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br />prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br /><br />  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br />reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br />violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br />received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br />copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br />your receipt of the notice.<br /><br />  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br />licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br />this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br />reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br />material under section 10.<br /><br />  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br /><br />  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br />run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br />occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br />to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br />nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br />modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br />not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br />covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br /><br />  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br /><br />  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br />receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br />propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br />for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br /><br />  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br />organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br />organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br />work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br />transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br />licenses to the work the party\'s predecessor in interest had or could<br />give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br />Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br />the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br /><br />  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br />rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br />not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br />rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br />(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br />any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br />sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br /><br />  11. Patents.<br /><br />  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br />License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br />work thus licensed is called the contributor\'s "contributor version".<br /><br />  A contributor\'s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br />owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br />hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br />by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br />but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br />consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br />purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br />patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br />this License.<br /><br />  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br />patent license under the contributor\'s essential patent claims, to<br />make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br />propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br /><br />  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br />agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br />(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br />sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br />party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br />patent against the party.<br /><br />  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br />and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br />to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br />publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br />then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br />available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br />patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br />consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br />license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br />actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br />covered work in a country, or your recipient\'s use of the covered work<br />in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br />country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br /><br />  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br />arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br />covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br />receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br />or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br />you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br />work and works based on it.<br /><br />  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br />the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br />conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br />specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br />work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br />in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br />to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br />the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br />parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br />patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br />conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br />for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br />contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br />or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br /><br />  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br />any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br />otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br /><br />  12. No Surrender of Others\' Freedom.<br /><br />  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br />covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br />not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br />to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br />the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br />License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br /><br />  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br /><br />  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br />permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br />under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br />combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br />License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br />but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br />section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br />combination as such.<br /><br />  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br /><br />  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br />the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br />be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />address new problems or concerns.<br /><br />  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br />Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br />Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br />option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br />version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br />Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br />GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br />by the Free Software Foundation.<br /><br />  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br />versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\'s<br />public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br />to choose that version for the Program.<br /><br />  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br />permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br />author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br />later version.<br /><br />  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br /><br />  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br />APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br />HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br />OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br />THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br />IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br />ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br /><br />  16. Limitation of Liability.<br /><br />  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br />THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br />GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br />USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br />DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br />PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br />EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br />SUCH DAMAGES.<br /><br />  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br /><br />  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br />above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br />reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br />an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br />Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br />copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br /><br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br /><br />  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br />free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br /><br />  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br />to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br />the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br /><br />    &ltone line to give the program\'s name and a brief idea of what it does.&rt<br />    Copyright (C) &ltyear&rt  &ltname of author&rt<br /><br />    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br />    (at your option) any later version.<br /><br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br />    GNU General Public License for more details.<br /><br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br />    along with this program.  If not, see &lthttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/&rt.<br /><br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br /><br />  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br />notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br /><br />    &ltprogram&rt  Copyright (C) &ltyear&rt  &ltname of author&rt<br />    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w\'.<br />    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br />    under certain conditions; type `show c\' for details.<br /><br />The hypothetical commands `show w\' and `show c\' should show the appropriate<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program\'s commands<br />might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br /><br />  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br />if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br />For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br />&lthttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/&rt.<br /><br />  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br />into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br />may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br />the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br />Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br />&lthttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&rt.<br />

Grant of Patent License.

If You<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br /><br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br />      meet the following conditions:<br /><br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br /><br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br />          stating that You changed the files; and<br /><br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br />          the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br />          as modifying the License.<br /><br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br />      the conditions stated in this License.<br /><br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast,<br />the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br />share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br />software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br />GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br />any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br />your programs, too.<br /><br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br />want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br />free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br /><br />  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br />these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br />certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br />you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br /><br />  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br />gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br />freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br />or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br />know their rights.<br /><br />  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br />(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br />giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br /><br />  For the developers\' and authors\' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br />that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\' and<br />authors\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br />changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br />authors of previous versions.<br /><br />  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br />modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br />can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br />protecting users\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br />pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br />use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br />have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br />products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br />stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br />of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br /><br />  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br />States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br />software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br />avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br />make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br />patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br /><br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />modification follow.<br /><br />                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />  0. Definitions.<br /><br />  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br /><br />  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br />works, such as semiconductor masks.<br /><br />  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br />License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br />"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br /><br />  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br />in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br />exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br />earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br /><br />  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br />on the Program.<br /><br />  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br />permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br />infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br />computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br />distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br />public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br /><br />  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br />parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br />a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br /><br />  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br />to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br />feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br />tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br />extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br />work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br />the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br />menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br /><br />  1. Source Code.<br /><br />  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br />for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br />form of a work.<br /><br />  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br />standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br />interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br />is widely used among developers working in that language.<br /><br />  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br />than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br />packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br />Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br />Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br />implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br />"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br />(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br />(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br />produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br /><br />  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br />the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br />work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br />control those activities.  However, it does not include the work\'s<br />System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br />programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br />which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br />includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br />the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br />linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br />such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br />subprograms and other parts of the work.<br /><br />  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br />can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br />Source.<br /><br />  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br />same work.<br /><br />  2. Basic Permissions.<br /><br />  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br />copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br />conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br />permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br />covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br />content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br />rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br /><br />  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br />convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br />in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br />of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br />with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br />the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br />not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br />for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br />and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br />your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br /><br />  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br />the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br />makes it unnecessary.<br /><br />  3. Protecting Users\' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br /><br />  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br />measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br />11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br />similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br />measures.<br /><br />  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br />circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br />is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br />the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br />modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\'s<br />users, your or third parties\' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br />technological measures.<br /><br />  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br /><br />  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\'s source code as you<br />receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br />appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br />keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br />non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br />keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br />recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br /><br />  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br />and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br /><br />  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br /><br />  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br />produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br />terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br /><br />    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br />    it, and giving a relevant date.<br /><br />    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br />    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br />    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br />    "keep intact all notices".<br /><br />    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br />    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br />    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br />    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br />    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br />    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br />    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br /><br />    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br />    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br />    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br />    work need not make them do so.<br /><br />  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br />works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br />and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br />in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br />"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br />used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\'s users<br />beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br />in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br />parts of the aggregate.<br /><br />  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br /><br />  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br />of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br />machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br />in one of these ways:<br /><br />    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br />    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br />    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br />    customarily used for software interchange.<br /><br />    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br />    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br />    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br />    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br />    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br />    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br />    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br />    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br />    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br />    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br />    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br /><br />    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br />    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br />    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br />    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br />    with subsection 6b.<br /><br />    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br />    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br />    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br />    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br />    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br />    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br />    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br />    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br />    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br />    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br />    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br />    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br /><br />    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br />    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br />    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br />    charge under subsection 6d.<br /><br />  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br />from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br />included in conveying the object code work.<br /><br />  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br />tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br />or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br />into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br />doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br />product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br />typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br />of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br />actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br />is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br />commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br />the only significant mode of use of the product.<br /><br />  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br />procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br />and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br />a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br />suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br />code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br />modification has been made.<br /><br />  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br />specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br />part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br />User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br />fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br />Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br />by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br />if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br />modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br />been installed in ROM).<br /><br />  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br />requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br />for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br />the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br />network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br />adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br />protocols for communication across the network.<br /><br />  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br />in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br />documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br />source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br />unpacking, reading or copying.<br /><br />  7. Additional Terms.<br /><br />  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br />License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br />Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br />be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br />that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br />apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br />under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br />this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br /><br />  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br />remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br />it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br />removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br />additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br />for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br /><br />  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br />add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br />that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br /><br />    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br />    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br /><br />    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br />    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br />    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br /><br />    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br />    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br />    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br /><br />    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br />    authors of the material; or<br /><br />    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br />    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br /><br />    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br />    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br />    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br />    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br />    those licensors and authors.<br /><br />  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br />restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br />received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br />governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br />restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br />a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br />License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br />of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br />not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br /><br />  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br />must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br />additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br />where to find the applicable terms.<br /><br />  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br />form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br />the above requirements apply either way.<br /><br />  8. Termination.<br /><br />  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br />provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br />modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br />this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br />paragraph of section 11).<br /><br />  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br />license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br />provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br />finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br />holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br />prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br /><br />  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br />reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br />violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br />received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br />copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br />your receipt of the notice.<br /><br />  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br />licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br />this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br />reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br />material under section 10.<br /><br />  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br /><br />  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br />run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br />occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br />to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br />nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br />modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br />not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br />covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br /><br />  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br /><br />  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br />receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br />propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br />for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br /><br />  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br />organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br />organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br />work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br />transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br />licenses to the work the party\'s predecessor in interest had or could<br />give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br />Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br />the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br /><br />  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br />rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br />not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br />rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br />(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br />any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br />sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br /><br />  11. Patents.<br /><br />  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br />License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br />work thus licensed is called the contributor\'s "contributor version".<br /><br />  A contributor\'s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br />owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br />hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br />by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br />but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br />consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br />purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br />patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br />this License.<br /><br />  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br />patent license under the contributor\'s essential patent claims, to<br />make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br />propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br /><br />  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br />agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br />(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br />sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br />party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br />patent against the party.<br /><br />  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br />and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br />to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br />publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br />then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br />available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br />patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br />consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br />license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br />actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br />covered work in a country, or your recipient\'s use of the covered work<br />in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br />country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br /><br />  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br />arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br />covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br />receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br />or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br />you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br />work and works based on it.<br /><br />  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br />the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br />conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br />specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br />work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br />in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br />to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br />the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br />parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br />patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br />conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br />for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br />contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br />or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br /><br />  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br />any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br />otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br /><br />  12. No Surrender of Others\' Freedom.<br /><br />  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br />covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br />not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br />to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br />the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br />License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br /><br />  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br /><br />  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br />permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br />under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br />combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br />License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br />but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br />section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br />combination as such.<br /><br />  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br /><br />  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br />the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br />be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />address new problems or concerns.<br /><br />  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br />Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br />Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br />option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br />version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br />Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br />GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br />by the Free Software Foundation.<br /><br />  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br />versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\'s<br />public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br />to choose that version for the Program.<br /><br />  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br />permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br />author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br />later version.<br /><br />  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br /><br />  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br />APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br />HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br />OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br />THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br />IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br />ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br /><br />  16. Limitation of Liability.<br /><br />  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br />THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br />GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br />USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br />DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br />PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br />EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br />SUCH DAMAGES.<br /><br />  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br /><br />  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br />above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br />reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br />an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br />Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br />copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br /><br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br />      meet the following conditions:<br /><br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br /><br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br />          stating that You changed the files; and<br /><br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br />          the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br />          as modifying the License.<br /><br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br />      the conditions stated in this License.<br /><br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br /><br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br /><br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"<br />      replaced with your own identifying information.

                                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />               Version 2, June 1991<br /><br /> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br /><br />                Preamble<br /><br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br />software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br />General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br />Foundation\'s software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br />using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br />the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br />your programs, too.<br /><br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br />if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br />in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br /><br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br />These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br />distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br /><br />  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br />gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br />you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br />source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br />rights.<br /><br />  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br />(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br />distribute and/or modify the software.<br /><br />  Also, for each author\'s protection and ours, we want to make certain<br />that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br />software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br />want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br />that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br />authors\' reputations.<br /><br />  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br />patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br />program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br />program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br />patent must be licensed for everyone\'s free use or not licensed at all.<br /><br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />modification follow.<br />\x0c<br />            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br /><br />  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br />a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br />under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br />refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br />means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br />that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br />either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br />language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br />the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br /><br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br />running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br />is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br />Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br />Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br /><br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\'s<br />source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br />conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br />copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br />notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br />and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br />along with the Program.<br /><br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br />you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br /><br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br /><br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br /><br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br />    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br />    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br />    parties under the terms of this License.<br /><br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br />    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br />    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br />    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br />    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br />    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br />    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br />    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br />    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br />    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br />\x0c<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br /><br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />collective works based on the Program.<br /><br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br />with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />the scope of this License.<br /><br />  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br />under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br />Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br /><br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br />    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br />    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br /><br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br />    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br />    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br />    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br />    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br />    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br /><br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br />    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br />    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br />    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br />    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br /><br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br />code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br />associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br />control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br />special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br />anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br />form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br />operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br />itself accompanies the executable.<br /><br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br />access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br />access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br />distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br />\x0c<br />  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br />except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br />otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br />void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br />However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br />this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br />parties remain in full compliance.<br /><br />  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br />Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />the Program or works based on it.<br /><br />  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br />Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br />these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />restrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br />this License.<br /><br />  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br /><br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br />any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br />apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br />circumstances.<br /><br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />impose that choice.<br /><br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br />\x0c<br />  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br />may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br />those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br />countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br />the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br /><br />  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br />of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br />be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />address new problems or concerns.<br /><br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br />later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br />either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br />Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br />this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br />Foundation.<br /><br />  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br />programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br />to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br />Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br />make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br />of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br />of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br /><br />                NO WARRANTY<br /><br />  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br />FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br />OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br />PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br />OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br />MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br />TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br />PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br />REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br /><br />  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br />REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br />INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br />OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br />TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br />YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br />PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br />POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br /><br />             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />\x0c<br />        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br /><br />  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br />free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br /><br />  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br />to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br />the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br /><br />    &ltone line to give the program\'s name and a brief idea of what it does.&rt<br />    Copyright (C) &ltyear&rt  &ltname of author&rt<br /><br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br />    (at your option) any later version.<br /><br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br />    GNU General Public License for more details.<br /><br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br />    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br />    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br /><br /><br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br /><br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br />when it starts in an interactive mode:<br /><br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author<br />    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w\'.<br />    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br />    under certain conditions; type `show c\' for details.<br /><br />The hypothetical commands `show w\' and `show c\' should show the appropriate<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br />be called something other than `show w\' and `show c\'; they could even be<br />mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br /><br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br /><br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br />  `Gnomovision\' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br /><br />  &ltsignature of Ty Coon&rt, 1 April 1989<br />  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br /><br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br />proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br />consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br />library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br />Public License instead of this License.<br />
